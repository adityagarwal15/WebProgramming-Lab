# 🔥 **Lab Highlights**

# **Lab 2: jQuery**

In **Lab 2**, I focused on using **jQuery** to enhance interactivity and animation in web pages, alongside utilizing **HTML** and **CSS** for the structure and styling. The tasks involved creating animations, handling user interactions, and developing dynamic web elements.

### **Lab Exercises:**

- 📝 **Table with Data and Animation**: Created a web page with a 3x3 table filled with sample data and an image. Styled the rows with alternate colors and added functionality to move both the table and the image from right to left when a button is clicked.

- 💻 **Basic Calculator**: Designed a simple web-based calculator to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The calculator used textboxes and buttons for input and output.

- 🎉 **Birthday Card Design**: Created a visually appealing birthday card-style web page with a personalized message and attractive design elements suitable for a greeting card.
