### **Lab 4: Python Programming**

In **Lab 4**, I explored core Python programming concepts through a series of exercises. The focus was on practicing various algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming techniques. The key objectives were to improve problem-solving skills and implement Python classes and functions for different scenarios.

## **Objectives of Lab 4:**

- üßë‚Äçüíª **File Handling**: Implement file operations to read, write, and manipulate data within files.
- üî¢ **Recursion & Algorithms**: Practice implementing common algorithms such as binary search with recursion.
- üìä **Sorting & Searching**: Learn about sorting techniques like alphabetical sorting and efficient searching methods.
- üóÇÔ∏è **Data Structures**: Understand and implement class structures to handle arrays, sets, and pairs of elements.
- üíª **Class Implementation**: Work with Python classes to model various functionalities like finding pairs from arrays and computing powers.

## **Lab Exercises:**

1. **Reverse Content of a File**:
   - Write a Python program to reverse the content of a file and store it in another file.

2. **Binary Search with Recursion**:
   - Implement a Python program that performs a binary search on a sorted list using recursion.

3. **Sort Words in Alphabetical Order**:
   - Create a Python program that sorts words in a list in alphabetical order.

4. **Get All Possible Unique Subsets**:
   - Write a Python class that returns all unique subsets from a set of distinct integers. 
   - Example Input: `[4,5,6]`
   - Example Output: `[[], [6], [5], [5, 6], [4], [4, 6], [4, 5], [4, 5, 6]]`

5. **Find Pair with Target Sum**:
   - Write a Python class to find a pair of elements (indices of the two numbers) from an array whose sum equals a specific target number.
   - Example Input: `numbers = [10,20,10,40,50,60,70], target = 50`
   - Example Output: `3, 4`

6. **Implement Power Function**:
   - Write a Python class that implements the `pow(x, n)` function, which computes `x` raised to the power `n`.

7. **String Methods**:
   - Write a Python class with two methods: `get_String` to accept a string from the user and `print_String` to print the string in uppercase.

## **Home Assignments:**

1. **Smallest Element Selection**:
   - Write a Python program to select the smallest element from a list in expected linear time.

2. **Bubble Sort Implementation**:
   - Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers.

3. **Matrix Multiplication**:
   - Write a Python program to multiply two matrices.

4. **Valid Parentheses Check**:
   - Write a Python class to check the validity of a string of parentheses. Ensure that the brackets are closed in the correct order (e.g., `()`, `[]`, `{}` are valid).

5. **Reverse String Word by Word**:
   - Write a Python class that reverses a string word by word.

6. **Circle Class**:
   - Write a Python class named `Circle` with methods to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle, given its radius.
